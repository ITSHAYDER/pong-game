Pong Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic game Pong, created with Python and Pygame. The game features two paddles and a ball, which the players use to hit the ball back and forth across the screen. The objective of the game is to score points by hitting the ball past the opponent's paddle.

How to Play
The game is played with two players, each controlling a paddle on either side of the screen.
The left player controls their paddle using the "W" and "S" keys, while the right player controls their paddle using the "Up" and "Down" arrow keys.
To start the game, the ball will be served from the center of the screen. The player who scores 3 points first wins the game.
If the ball hits the top or bottom of the screen, it will bounce back in the opposite direction.
If the ball hits a paddle, it will bounce back in the opposite direction, with its speed increasing slightly.
If the ball goes past a paddle and off the screen, the opposing player will score a point, and the ball will be served again from the center of the screen.
How to Run the Game
To run the game, you will need to have Python and Pygame installed on your computer. Once you have installed these, follow these steps:

Download the main.py, ball.py, and paddles.py files from this repository.
Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the files.
Type python main.py to start the game.
Dependencies
The game was developed using Python 3.9.7 and Pygame 2.1.2.
